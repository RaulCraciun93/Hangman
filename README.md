### Project Overview

The Hangman game is a classic word-guessing game where players aim to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as:
* Input validation
* Conditional logic
* Iteration
* Use external libraries for styling the terminal

### Features

- **Random word selection**: A random word is chosen from a predefined word bank.
- **Player guess input**: Players can guess one letter at a time.
- **Word progress**: Display the word with guessed letters revealed and underscores for unguessed letters.
- **Remaining attempts**: Track and display the number of attempts left.
- **Win/Lose condition**: The game ends when the player guesses the word or runs out of attempts.

### Technologies Used

- **Python 3**: Programming language.
- **Colorama**: For colored text to the terminal.
